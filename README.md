Understanding the city health of a ride hailing app
We want to know which cities are the healthiest, where there is room for improvement and how you might go about this. 
Use the attached spreadsheet for this task and produce a short presentation to walk through the reasoning that you use to answer the questions:

 - How would you define the health of a city? What would be your key metric(s)?
 - Using this definition which are the healthiest and least healthy cities and why?
 - If you had limited resources to work on improving the health of cities, which cities would be your top priorities? Which metrics would you use to decide?
 - For a high priority city, what do you think are the major health issues / opportunities? What types of
  operational and product improvements could we make to improve the marketplace?
 - What other data sources would you want in an ideal world to help answer any of the questions above?
